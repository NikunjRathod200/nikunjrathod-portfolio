# One-page Portfolio (Resume → Website)

This is a minimal, responsive single-page portfolio built from a résumé-style layout.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page. Edit the sections (About, Experience, Projects, Skills, Contact).
- `styles.css` — styles for layout and theme.
- `script.js` — small UI helpers (smooth scroll, nav toggle, contact mailto).

Quick start (view locally):

```bash
# from this folder
cd /Users/nikunjrathod/Project/portfolio
# serve on http://localhost:8000
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

Customization tips:
- Replace placeholder text (YOUR NAME, you@example.com, project descriptions) in `index.html`.
- Replace `resume.pdf` with your actual resume file if you want the download link to work.
- Update the email in `script.js` (variable `to`) for the contact form behavior.
- To deploy, you can push these files to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel as a static site.

Want me to:
- Plug your actual resume content into the template? (I can extract text if you upload your resume.)
- Style it to match your favorite colors and fonts?
- Prepare a GitHub Pages-friendly `index.html` and commit/README automation?

Tell me which of the above you'd like next and share your resume or preferences if you want content inserted.
